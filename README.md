<h1>Admission_Prediction_With_ML</h1>
# 
# Created this Machine Learning Model to find out the scores required for different tests to have better admission chances and get into a good graduate school.

This project uses machine learning to predict the chances of a student being admitted to a graduate program. The project uses a dataset of historical admission data.

The data is preprocessed and analyzed using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. A regression model is then trained on the data to predict the chances of admission. The model is evaluated using a variety of metrics.

The project was implemented in Python using the Jupyter Notebook environment. The code is well-documented and easy to follow. The project also includes a detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the implications for admissions decisions.
